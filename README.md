Modern life is dominated by digital screens, and many of us are glued to our smartphones, computers, and other devices for hours each day.
However,prolonged exposure to the blue light these screens produce can damage your eyes, headaches, and other problems. 
This study describes a technique to protect the eyes from the harmful effects of prolonged screen use. 
Our system uses Python, OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect the user's face and the distance between the eye and the display is calculated and rotate the display screen to reduce eye strains and other problems. 
Anyone who spends a lot of time on their digital devices will find this system very useful as it is easy to use. This system was tested between the distance range of 45 to 50 cm. 
This system is very affordable and does not require any proprietary sensor or powerful and expensive hardware. The results show that the average accuracy of 100% and 90% are achieved in the iris detection.
